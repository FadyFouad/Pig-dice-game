# Pig-dice-game

Pig is a simple dice game which in its basic form is playable with just a single die. You win by being the first player to score 100 or more points.

The player may continue rolling and accumulating points (but risk rolling a 1) or end his turn.

If the player rolls a 1 his turn is over, he loses all points he accumulated that turn, and he passes the die to the next player.

Play passes from player to player until a winner is determined.

# Winning the Game
The first player to score 100 points wins the game!
